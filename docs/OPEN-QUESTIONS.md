# OPEN QUESTIONS — ONE PLACE FOR EVERYTHING NEEDING A DECISION

**This is the only file that collects questions. Nothing gets asked anywhere else.**

## 🔴 Q14 [EITHER] · E4 HAS RUN. The mechanism is huge; the headline claim is null. Decide n BEFORE rerunning.

**A: read `results/E4-FIRST-RESULTS.md` before anything else.** 40 cells, 78 seconds, on your v8 ensemble.

**What worked, unambiguously:**

- Over-prediction is enormous and scales with κ exactly as designed: **+9.2 → +5.6 → +3.3 → +2.0**, against a response whose max is ~1.0. Every cell extrapolated (40/40).
- The GP over-promises **5–20× less** than the polynomial at every κ.
- **Your Q13 risk did not materialise: 0/40 cells had the peak inside the training corner.** The validity check stays regardless.
- Headroom healthy everywhere (0.83–0.88, threshold 0.95). Practitioner-fit failures: 0/40.

**What did not:**

> **The GP does not beat plain nearest-neighbour distance. Pooled +0.051, CI [−0.003, +0.100], not significant.** Same at every κ. Against the polynomial's own interval width it is +0.004 — flatly nothing.

That is the comparison E4 was built around. On this evidence the honest statement is *the GP is an expensive distance function*.

**But it is a power problem, not a flat null.** All four κ point the same way; the pooled interval misses zero by 0.003; headroom confirms the comparison could have resolved a difference. Instances needed at the observed effect: **~31 at κ=0.6, ~44 at κ=0.8, ~10 at κ=0.9.** We have 10. **The full grid costs 78 seconds — 40 instances is about five minutes.**

**THE DECISION, AND IT MUST BE MADE BEFORE THE RERUN.** Raising n after seeing a result that missed significance, then reporting it as though n had been chosen in advance, is what makes a finding unpublishable. If we scale: bump `preregistration_version` to 2 and state in the paper — *"the first run at the pre-registered n was underpowered for the paired comparison; n was raised on a power calculation performed on that run."* Defensible. A silent rerun is not.

**B's recommendation:** bundle the n decision with Q12 into a single version-2 pre-registration, then run once.

### Unpredicted finding, worth its own line

**Every fitted surface was a saddle. 40/40.** No maxima, no minima. The spec predicted a mix and specifically warned that low κ would give *minima*. It was wrong, cleanly. This is exactly why the stationary-point **distribution** was required instead of a bare escape rate — a rate would have hidden it.

## 🟠 Q12 [EITHER] · A was right, and the numbers now say so

A argued the unit cube is indefensible: 2–4× extrapolation in all six coordinates at once, against the published study's 1.2× in one.

**The run confirms it.** At over-prediction +9.2 with an interval width ~7 on a response of max 1.0, **"the traditional method's interval is too narrow" is not available as a finding** — the interval covers almost anything. A reviewer would call the comparison staged and be right.

`extended_box_bounds(x_star, kappa, rho)` is in `designs.py`, tested, with the default reproducing current behaviour exactly. **This is now a config decision, not a code change.**

**B agrees with A.** Recommend κ=0.6, ρ=2.0 primary, unit cube reported as a limiting case — folded into the same version-2 bump as Q14.

## 🟡 Q13 [ALAN] · A's oracle deviates from spec §4 three ways — B's veto, still unexercised

**B's position: accept.** A's evidence is measured, not asserted — the spec's interaction term provably cannot move the optimum (0.00e+00 shift over 276 instances), which makes §4.6's own non-separability check unpassable. The risk A flagged as landing in B's lane is now **tested and did not occur** (0/40).

**Alan holds the veto.** Nothing further from B is needed here.

## 🟡 Q7 [ALAN] · Author order, and whether the code can be released publicly

Neither blocks building. Both block posting the preprint.

## ✅ CLOSED

| | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | Does the oracle exist? | **Yes — ported, merged, 310 tests passing. E4 has run on it.** |
| **Q2** | Who owns `designs.py`? | B owns it; A deleted their copy and is second reader. |
| **Q3** | Test-function wrappers? | Exist, wearing the Evaluator interface. |
| **Q4** | Evaluator interface? | Confirmed by execution. No adapters needed. |
| **Q5** | qLogEI vs qLogNEI? | Run both. qLogEI pre-registered primary, qLogNEI declared secondary. |
| **Q8** | `Yvar` floor? | `sigma_add**2 = 1e-4`. |
| **Q9** | Face-centred vs rotatable? | Face-centred — rotatable axials leave the sub-box. |
| **Q10** | The two pre-registered numbers | 512 candidates, τ = within-instance 0.80 quantile. **Version 2 now proposed — see Q14.** |
| **Q11** | First commit / layout | Done, pushed, shared. |
| **C1** | `observation_noise=True` at unrun points? | Silently averages training noise. Never used. |
| **C2** | Units for supplied noise? | Standardized, not raw. Off by 161× otherwise. |
| **C3** | `Normalize` without bounds? | Learns from data. Always pass explicit bounds. |
| **C4** | Discrete-candidate function? | `optimize_acqf_discrete(...)`. |
| **C5** | Does batch selection cluster? | No — it conditions on each pick. |
| **C6** | Grid too slow? | No. Full E4 is 78 seconds. |
| **C7** | 48-run pattern arithmetic? | Exact: 32 + 12 + 4. |
| **C8** | Stepwise conditioning via pinv? | Non-issue — rank filter guarantees full rank; agrees with lstsq to 9.7e-13. |

## Where B is up to

**E4 is built, tested, and has produced results on real landscapes.** 310 tests. Reproduce with `python scripts/run_e4.py`.

**Blocked on:** the Q14 n-decision and the Q12 regime decision — both must be settled *before* the next run, together, as one pre-registration bump.

**Not yet built:** figures (spec Build Step 7), and an untested `nonlinear_inequality_constraints` path that matters only for Phase 3.
